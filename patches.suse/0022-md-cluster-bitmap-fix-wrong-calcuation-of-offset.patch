Subject: [PATCH 22/24] md-cluster/bitmap: fix wrong calcuation of offset
Git-commit: 7f86ffed9b5f3f0b1a29108c5e965942b935ec98
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1
References: fate#316335

The offset is wrong in bitmap_storage_alloc, we should
set it like below in bitmap_init_from_disk().

node_offset = bitmap->cluster_slot * (DIV_ROUND_UP(store->bytes, PAGE_SIZE));

Because 'offset' is only assigned to 'page->index' and
that is usually over-written by read_sb_page. So it does
not cause problem in general, but it still need to be fixed.

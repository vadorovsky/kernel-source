Subject: [PATCH] libceph: remove outdated comment
Git-commit: 7e01726a6853e032536ed7e75c1e1232872ff318
Patch-mainline: v4.5
References: Fate#318586

MClientMount{,Ack} are long gone.  The receipt of bare monmap doesn't
actually indicate a mount success as we are yet to authenticate at that
point in time.

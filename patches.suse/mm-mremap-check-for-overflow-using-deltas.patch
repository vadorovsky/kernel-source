Subject: [PATCH] mm: mremap: check for overflow using deltas
References: THP mremap optimisation and THP support (fate#311931)
Patch-mainline: No, in mm as of Sept 6th, 2011

Using "- 1" relies on the old_end to be page aligned and PAGE_SIZE > 1,
those are reasonable requirements but the check remains obscure and it
looks more like an off by one error than an overflow check.  This I feel
will improve readability.

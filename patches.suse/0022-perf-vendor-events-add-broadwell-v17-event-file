Subject: perf vendor events: Add Broadwell V17 event file
Git-commit: b74d1315cab113ce1e0ee5e10eb6638219c1b0d1
Patch-mainline: v4.10-rc1
References: FATE#319936, bsc#1030064
Signed-off-by: Tony Jones <tonyj@suse.de>

Add a Intel event file for perf.

Committer note:

Testing it on a ThinkPad t450s:

  [acme@jouet linux]$ perf list
<SNIP>
  Cache:
    l1d.replacement
         [L1D data line replacements]
    l1d_pend_miss.fb_full
         [Cycles a demand request was blocked due to Fill Buffers inavailability]
    l1d_pend_miss.pending
         [L1D miss oustandings duration in cycles]
    l1d_pend_miss.pending_cycles
         [Cycles with L1D load Misses outstanding]
<SNIP>

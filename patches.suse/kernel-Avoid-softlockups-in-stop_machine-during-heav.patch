Subject: [PATCH 6/6] kernel: Avoid softlockups in stop_machine() during heavy
 printing
Patch-mainline: Never, refused upstream for now
References: bnc#744692, bnc#789311

When there are lots of messages accumulated in printk buffer, printing
them (especially over serial console) can take a long time (tens of
seconds). stop_machine() will effectively make all cpus spin in
multi_cpu_stop() waiting for the CPU doing printing to print all the
messages which triggers NMI softlockup watchdog and RCU stall detector
which add even more to the messages to print. Since machine doesn't do
anything (except serving interrupts) during this time, also network
connections are dropped and other disturbances may happen.

Paper over the problem by waiting for printk buffer to be empty before
starting to stop CPUs. In theory a burst of new messages can be appended
to the printk buffer before CPUs enter multi_cpu_stop() so this isn't a 100%
solution but it works OK in practice and I'm not aware of a reasonably
simple better solution.

Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Enable RCU tracepoints by default to aid in debugging
Patch-mainline: v4.11-rc1
Git-commit: 961518259b3ba79a3cfc634794dc12ea9565dac4
References: bsc#1022317

While debugging a performance issue I needed to understand why
RCU sofitrqs were firing so frequently.

Unfortunately, the RCU callback tracepoints are hidden behind
CONFIG_RCU_TRACE which defaults to off in the upstream kernel and is
likely to also be disabled in enterprise distribution configs.

Enable it by default for CONFIG_TREE_RCU. However, we must keep it
disabled for tiny RCU, because it would otherwise pull in a large
amount of code that would make tiny RCU less than tiny.

I ran some file system metadata intensive workloads (git checkout,
FS-Mark) on a variety of machines with this patch and saw no
detectable change in performance.

Subject: [PATCH 24/24] md-cluster/bitmap: unplug bitmap to sync dirty pages to
 disk
Git-commit: c84400c89f0f98ae4a73ed89886239b67d1dcd31
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1
References: fate#316335 bsc#971908

This patch is doing two distinct but related things.

1. It adds bitmap_unplug() for the main bitmap (mddev->bitmap).  As bit
have been set, BITMAP_PAGE_DIRTY is set so bitmap_deamon_work() will
not write those pages out in its regular scans, only bitmap_unplug()
will.  If there are no writes to the array, bitmap_unplug() won't be
called, so we need to call it explicitly here.

2. bitmap_write_all() is a bit of a confusing interface as it doesn't
actually write anything.  The current code for writing "bitmap" works
but this change makes it a bit clearer.

Subject: Drivers: hv: balloon: reset host_specified_ha_region
Git-commit: d19a55d6ed5bf0ffe553df2d8bf91d054ddf2d76
References: fate#320485

We set host_specified_ha_region = true on certain request but this is a
global state which stays 'true' forever. We need to reset it when we
receive a request where ha_region is not specified. I did not see any
real issues, the bug was found by code inspection.

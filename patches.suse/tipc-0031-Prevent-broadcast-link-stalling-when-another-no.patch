Subject: [PATCH 031/183] tipc: Prevent broadcast link stalling when another
 node fails
Git-commit: 757918d1744bd58c479ba5d7d6989774d4807f6b
Patch-mainline: Merged into tipc-devel
References: bnc#797455

Ensure that broadcast link messages that have not been acknowledged
by a newly failed node do not get an implied acknowledgement until the
failed node is removed from the broadcast link's map of reachable nodes.

Previously, a race condition allowed a new broadcast link message to be
sent after the implicit acknowledgement processing was completed, but
before the map of reachable nodes was updated, resulting in the message
having an expected acknowledgement count that required the failed node
to explicitly acknowledge the message. Since this would never occur
the new message would remain in the broadcast link's transmit queue
forever, eventually causing the link to become congested and "stall".
Delaying the implicit acknowledgement processing until after the update
of the map of reachable nodes eliminates this race condition and prevents
stalling.

Subject: [PATCH] sched/numa: Cap PTE scanning overhead to 3% of run time

References: Automatic NUMA Balancing (fate#315482)
Patch-mainline: v4.5
Git-commit: 51170840fe91dfca10fd533b303ea39b2524782a

There is a fundamental mismatch between the runtime based NUMA scanning
at the task level, and the wall clock time NUMA scanning at the mm level.
On a severely overloaded system, with very large processes, this mismatch
can cause the system to spend all of its time in change_prot_numa().

This can happen if the task spends at least two ticks in change_prot_numa(),
and only gets two ticks of CPU time in the real time between two scan
intervals of the mm.

This patch ensures that a task never spends more than 3% of run
time scanning PTEs. It does that by ensuring that in-between
task_numa_work() runs, the task spends at least 32x as much time on
other things than it did on task_numa_work().

This is done stochastically: if a timer tick happens, or the task
gets rescheduled during task_numa_work(), we delay a future run of
task_numa_work() until the task has spent at least 32x the amount of
CPU time doing something else, as it spent inside task_numa_work().
The longer task_numa_work() takes, the more likely it is this happens.

If task_numa_work() takes very little time, chances are low that that
code will do anything, but we will not care.

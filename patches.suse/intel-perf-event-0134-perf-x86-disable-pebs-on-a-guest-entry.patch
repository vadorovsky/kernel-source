Subject: perf/x86: disable PEBS on a guest entry.
References: bnc#789200, fate#313753, fate#312066, fate#313762
Patch-mainline: v3.6-rc3
Git-commit: 26a4f3c08de49c1437a7b7f97693cf22d8c31656

If PMU counter has PEBS enabled it is not enough to disable counter
on a guest entry since PEBS memory write can overshoot guest entry
and corrupt guest memory. Disabling PEBS during guest entry solves
the problem.

Subject: [PATCH 033/183] tipc: Remove deferred queue head caching during
 broadcast message reception
Git-commit: f04e5491c283bafb1b82885f3c665ebf4827e781
Patch-mainline: Merged into tipc-devel
References: bnc#797455

Modifies TIPC's incoming broadcast packet handler so that it no longer
pre-reads information about the deferred packet queue, since the cached
value is unreliable once the associated node lock has been released.

Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: hold a ref on the inode during writepages

We can race with unlink and not actually be able to do our igrab in
btrfs_add_ordered_extent.  This will result in all sorts of problems.
Instead of doing the complicated work to try and handle returning an error
properly from btrfs_add_ordered_extent, just hold a ref to the inode during
writepages.  If we cannot grab a ref we know we're freeing this inode anyway
and can just drop the dirty pages on the floor, because screw them we're
going to invalidate them anyway.  Thanks,

Subject: Cause IO to O_DIRECT|O_NONBLOCK devices to use REQ_FAILFAST_DEV
Patch-mainline: unlikely
References: bnc#750141

Linux can mark IO requests as FAILFAST to the device doesn't try so hard.

This functionality is currently not available via block-special-file access.

It only makes sense with O_DIRECT, and seems to fit with O_NONBLOCK,
so arrange that a block device opened with these two flags causes
REQ_FAILFAST_DEV to be used.

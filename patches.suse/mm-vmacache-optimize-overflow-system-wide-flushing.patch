Subject: [PATCH] mm,vmacache: optimize overflow system-wide flushing
Git-commit: 6b4ebc3a9078c5b7b8c4cf495a0b1d2d0e0bfe7a
Patch-mainline: 3.16
References: VM Performance

For single threaded workloads, we can avoid flushing and iterating through
the entire list of tasks, making the whole function a lot faster,
requiring only a single atomic read for the mm_users.

Subject: [PATCH 21/24] md-cluster: sync bitmap when node received RESYNCING
 msg
Git-commit: 18c9ff7f487efa8e88886bee21bd3516dde05bc5
Patch-mainline: v4.7-rc1 
References: fate#316335

If the node received RESYNCING message which means
another node will perform resync with the area, then
we don't want to do it again in another node.

Let's set RESYNC_MASK and clear NEEDED_MASK for the
region from old-low to new-low which has finished
syncing, and the region from old-hi to new-hi is about
to syncing, bitmap_sync_with_cluste is introduced for
the purpose.

Subject: mm: Ignore mempolicies when using ALLOC_NO_WATERMARK
References: Swap over NFS (fate#304949)
Patch-mainline: no

The reserve is proportionally distributed over all !highmem zones in the
system. So we need to allow an emergency allocation access to all zones.
In order to do that we need to break out of any mempolicy boundaries we
might have.

In my opinion that does not break mempolicies as those are user oriented
and not system oriented. That is, system allocations are not guaranteed to
be within mempolicy boundaries. For instance IRQs don't even have a mempolicy.

So breaking out of mempolicy boundaries for 'rare' emergency allocations,
which are always system allocations (as opposed to user) is ok.

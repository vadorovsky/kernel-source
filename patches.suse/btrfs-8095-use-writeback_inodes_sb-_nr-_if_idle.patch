Subject: [PATCH] vfs: re-implement writeback_inodes_sb(_nr)_if_idle() and
 rename them

[ full patch: http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-fsdevel/msg54844.html
  the code has been trimmed to only what btrfs at sp2 requires to avoid
  deadlocks with umount and autodefrag;
  kabi safe, btrfs part only ]

writeback_inodes_sb(_nr)_if_idle() is re-implemented by replacing down_read()
with down_read_trylock() because
- If ->s_umount is write locked, then the sb is not idle. That is
  writeback_inodes_sb(_nr)_if_idle() needn't wait for the lock.
- writeback_inodes_sb(_nr)_if_idle() grabs s_umount lock when it want to start
  writeback, it may bring us deadlock problem when doing umount.
  (Ex. Btrfs has such a problem, see the following URL
       http://marc.info/?l=linux-btrfs&m=133540923510561&w=2)

The name of these two functions is cumbersome, so rename them to
try_to_writeback_inodes_sb(_nr).

This idea came from Christoph Hellwig.
Some code is from the patch of Kamal Mostafa.

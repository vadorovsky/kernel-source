Subject: [PATCH] locking/rtmutex: Flip unlikely() branch to likely() in __rt_mutex_slowlock()
Git-commit: 4009f4b3a9d8b74547269f293e6a920adf278996
Patch-mainline: v4.11-rc1
References: bsc#969756

Running my likely/unlikely profiler for 3 weeks on two production
machines, I discovered that the unlikely() test in
__rt_mutex_slowlock() checking if state is TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE is hit
100% of the time, making it a very likely case.

The reason is, on a vanilla kernel, the majority case of calling
rt_mutex() is from the futex code. This code is always called as
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. In the -rt patch, this code is commonly called when
PREEMPT_RT is enabled with TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE. But that's not the
likely scenario.

The rt_mutex() code should be optimized for the common vanilla case,
and that is from a futex, with TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE as the state.

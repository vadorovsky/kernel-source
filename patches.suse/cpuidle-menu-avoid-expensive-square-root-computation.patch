Subject: [PATCH] cpuidle: menu: avoid expensive square root computation

References: bnc#969297 PM performance -- cpu idle
Patch-mainline: v4.6-rc1
Git-commit: 7024b18ca461bab45e5fb329f6e3d904d5109401

Computing the integer square root is a rather expensive operation, at
least compared to doing a 64x64 -> 64 multiply (avg*avg) and, on 64
bit platforms, doing an extra comparison to a constant (variance <=
U64_MAX/36).

On 64 bit platforms, this does mean that we add a restriction on the
range of the variance where we end up using the estimate (since
previously the stddev <= ULONG_MAX was a tautology), but on the other
hand, we extend the range quite substantially on 32 bit platforms - in
both cases, we now allow standard deviations up to 715 seconds, which
is for example guaranteed if all observations are less than 1430
seconds.

Subject: [PATCH 149/938] rbd: set snapc->seq only when refreshing header
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

In rbd_header_add_snap() there is code to set snapc->seq to the
just-added snapshot id.  This is the only remnant left of the
use of that field for recording which snapshot an rbd_dev was
associated with.  That functionality is no longer supported,
so get rid of that final bit of code.

Doing so means we never actually set snapc->seq any more.  On the
server, the snapshot context's sequence value represents the highest
snapshot id ever issued for a particular rbd image.  So we'll make
it have that meaning here as well.  To do so, set this value
whenever the rbd header is (re-)read.  That way it will always be
consistent with the rest of the snapshot context we maintain.

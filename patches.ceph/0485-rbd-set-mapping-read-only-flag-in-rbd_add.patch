Subject: [PATCH 485/938] rbd: set mapping read-only flag in rbd_add()
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

The rbd_dev->mapping field for a parent image is not meaningful.
Since rbd_image_probe() is used both for images being mapped and
their parents, it doesn't make sense to set that flag in that
function.

So move the setting of the mapping.read_only flag out of
rbd_dev_image_probe() and into rbd_add() instead.

This resolves:

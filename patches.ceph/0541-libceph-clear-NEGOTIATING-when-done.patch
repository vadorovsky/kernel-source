Subject: [PATCH 541/938] libceph: clear NEGOTIATING when done
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

A connection state's NEGOTIATING bit gets set while in CONNECTING
state after we have successfully exchanged a ceph banner and IP
addresses with the connection's peer (the server).  But that bit
is not cleared again--at least not until another connection attempt
is initiated.

Instead, clear it as soon as the connection is fully established.
Also, clear it when a socket connection gets prematurely closed
in the midst of establishing a ceph connection (in case we had
reached the point where it was set).

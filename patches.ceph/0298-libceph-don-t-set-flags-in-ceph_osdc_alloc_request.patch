Subject: [PATCH 298/938] libceph: don't set flags in ceph_osdc_alloc_request()
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

The only thing ceph_osdc_alloc_request() really does with the
flags value it is passed is assign it to the newly-created
osd request structure.  Do that in the caller instead.

Both callers subsequently call ceph_osdc_build_request(), so have
that function (instead of ceph_osdc_alloc_request()) issue a warning
if a request comes through with neither the read nor write flags set.

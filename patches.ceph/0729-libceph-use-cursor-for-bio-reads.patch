Subject: [PATCH 729/938] libceph: use cursor for bio reads
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Replace the use of the information in con->in_msg_pos for incoming
bio data.  The old in_msg_pos and the new cursor mechanism do
basically the same thing, just slightly differently.

The main functional difference is that in_msg_pos keeps track of the
length of the complete bio list, and assumed it was fully consumed
when that many bytes had been transferred.  The cursor does not assume
a length, it simply consumes all bytes in the bio list.  Because the
only user of bio data is the rbd client, and because the length of a
bio list provided by rbd client always matches the number of bytes
in the list, both ways of tracking length are equivalent.

In addition, for in_msg_pos the initial bio vector is selected as
the initial value of the bio->bi_idx, while the cursor assumes this
is zero.  Again, the rbd client always passes 0 as the initial index
so the effect is the same.

Other than that, they basically match:
    in_msg_pos      cursor
    ----------      ------
    bio_iter        bio
    bio_seg         vec_index
    page_pos        page_offset

The in_msg_pos field is initialized by a call to init_bio_iter().
The bio cursor is initialized by ceph_msg_data_cursor_init().
Both now happen in the same spot, in prepare_message_data().

The in_msg_pos field is advanced by a call to in_msg_pos_next(),
which updates page_pos and calls iter_bio_next() to move to the next
bio vector, or to the next bio in the list.  The cursor is advanced
by ceph_msg_data_advance().  That isn't currently happening so
add a call to that in in_msg_pos_next().

Finally, the next piece of data to use for a read is determined
by a bunch of lines in read_partial_message_bio().  Those can be
replaced by an equivalent ceph_msg_data_bio_next() call.

This partially resolves:

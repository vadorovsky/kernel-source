Subject: [PATCH 804/938] libceph: make ceph_con_revoke_message() a msg op
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

ceph_con_revoke_message() is passed both a message and a ceph
connection.  A ceph_msg allocated for incoming messages on a
connection always has a pointer to that connection, so there's no
need to provide the connection when revoking such a message.

Note that the existing logic does not preclude the message supplied
being a null/bogus message pointer.  The only user of this interface
is the OSD client, and the only value an osd client passes is a
request's r_reply field.  That is always non-null (except briefly in
an error path in ceph_osdc_alloc_request(), and that drops the
only reference so the request won't ever have a reply to revoke).
So we can safely assume the passed-in message is non-null, but add a
BUG_ON() to make it very obvious we are imposing this restriction.

Rename the function ceph_msg_revoke_incoming() to reflect that it is
really an operation on an incoming message.

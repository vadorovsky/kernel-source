Subject: [PATCH 448/938] rbd: fix up the layering warning message
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

A warning gets spewed for any image being probed, including parent
images.  Set up a condition such that the warning message only gets
printed for the image being mapped, not any of its parents.

Also, I didn't like the way the warning ended up being so long.
Make it a terse warning instead.  People experimenting with layering
will know what the message means.

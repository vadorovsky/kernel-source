Subject: [PATCH 726/938] libceph: initialize data fields on last msg put
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

When the last reference to a ceph message is dropped,
ceph_msg_last_put() is called to clean things up.

For "normal" messages (allocated via ceph_msg_new() rather than
being allocated from a memory pool) it's sufficient to just release
resources.  But for a mempool-allocated message we actually have to
re-initialize the data fields in the message back to initial state
so they're ready to go in the event the message gets reused.

Some of this was already done; this fleshes it out so it's done
more completely.

This resolves:

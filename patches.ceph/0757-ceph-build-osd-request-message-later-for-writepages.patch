Subject: [PATCH 757/938] ceph: build osd request message later for writepages
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Hold off building the osd request message in ceph_writepages_start()
until just before it will be submitted to the osd client for
execution.

We'll still create the request and allocate the page pointer array
after we learn we have at least one page to write.  A local variable
will be used to keep track of the allocated array of pages.  Wait
until just before submitting the request for assigning that page
array pointer to the request message.

Create ands use a new function osd_req_op_extent_update() whose
purpose is to serve this one spot where the length value supplied
when an osd request's op was initially formatted might need to get
changed (reduced, never increased) before submitting the request.

Previously, ceph_writepages_start() assigned the message header's
data length because of this update.  That's no longer necessary,
because ceph_osdc_build_request() will recalculate the right
value to use based on the content of the ops in the request.

Subject: [PATCH 406/938] rbd: activate support for layered images
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Now that we have most everything in place to support layered rbd
images, enable support for them in the kernel client.  Issue a
warning to the log that the support is considered experimental
whenever a format 2 layered image is mapped.

Note that we also have to claim to support the STRIPINGV2 feature,
due to a mistake in the way the rbd CLI set up those flags.  This
feature can work if it has the right parameters, and safeguards
have been put in place to reject those images that do not have
compatible parameters.

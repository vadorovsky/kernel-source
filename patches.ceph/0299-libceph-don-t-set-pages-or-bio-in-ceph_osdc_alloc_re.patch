Subject: [PATCH 299/938] libceph: don't set pages or bio in ceph_osdc_alloc_request()
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Only one of the two callers of ceph_osdc_alloc_request() provides
page or bio data for its payload.  And essentially all that function
was doing with those arguments was assigning them to fields in the
osd request structure.

Simplify ceph_osdc_alloc_request() by having the caller take care of
making those assignments

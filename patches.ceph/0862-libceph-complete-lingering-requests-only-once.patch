Subject: [PATCH 862/938] libceph: complete lingering requests only once
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

An osd request marked to linger will be re-submitted in the event
a connection to the target osd gets dropped.  Currently, if there
is a callback function associated with a request it will be called
each time a request is submitted--which for lingering requests can
be more than once.

Change it so a request--including lingering ones--will get completed
(from the perspective of the user of the osd client) exactly once.

This resolves:

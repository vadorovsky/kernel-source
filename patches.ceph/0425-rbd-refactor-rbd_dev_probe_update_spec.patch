Subject: [PATCH 425/938] rbd: refactor rbd_dev_probe_update_spec()
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Fairly straightforward refactoring of rbd_dev_probe_update_spec().
The name is changed to rbd_dev_spec_update().

Rearrange it so nothing gets assigned to the spec until all of the
names have been successfully acquired.

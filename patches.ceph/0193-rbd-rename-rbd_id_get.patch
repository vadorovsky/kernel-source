Subject: [PATCH 193/938] rbd: rename rbd_id_get()
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

This should have been done as part of this commit:

    commit de71a2970d57463d3d965025e33ec3adcf391248

    rbd: rename rbd_device->id

rbd_id_get() is assigning the rbd_dev->dev_id field.  Change the
name of that function as well as rbd_id_put() and rbd_id_max
to reflect what they are affecting.

Add some dynamic debug statements related to rbd device id activity.

Subject: [PATCH 897/938] ceph: move max constant definitions
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Move some definitions for max integer values out of the rbd code and
into the more central "decode.h" header file.  These really belong
in a Linux (or libc) header somewhere, but I haven't gotten around
to proposing that yet.

This is in preparation for moving some code out of rbd.c and into
the osd client.

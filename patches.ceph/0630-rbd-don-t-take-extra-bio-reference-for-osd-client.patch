Subject: [PATCH 630/938] rbd: don't take extra bio reference for osd client
Patch-mainline: 3.10-rc2
References: fate#312983

Currently, if the OSD client finds an osd request has had a bio list
attached to it, it drops a reference to it (or rather, to the first
entry on that list) when the request is released.

The code that added that reference (i.e., the rbd client) is
therefore required to take an extra reference to that first bio
structure.

The osd client doesn't really do anything with the bio pointer other
than transfer it from the osd request structure to outgoing (for
writes) and ingoing (for reads) messages.  So it really isn't the
right place to be taking or dropping references.

Furthermore, the rbd client already holds references to all bio
structures it passes to the osd client, and holds them until the
request is completed.  So there's no need for this extra reference
whatsoever.

So remove the bio_put() call in ceph_osdc_release_request(), as
well as its matching bio_get() call in rbd_osd_req_create().

This change could lead to a crash if old libceph.ko was used with
new rbd.ko.  Add a compatibility check at rbd initialization time to
avoid this possibilty.

This resolves:

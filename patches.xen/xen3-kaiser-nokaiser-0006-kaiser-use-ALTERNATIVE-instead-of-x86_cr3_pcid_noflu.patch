Subject: [PATCH 06/14] xen/kaiser: use ALTERNATIVE instead of x86_cr3_pcid_noflush
References: bsc#1068032 CVE-2017-5754
Patch-mainline: Never, SUSE-Xen specific

Now that we're playing the ALTERNATIVE game, use that more efficient
method: instead of user-mapping an extra page, and reading an extra
cacheline each time for x86_cr3_pcid_noflush.

Neel has found that __stringify(bts $X86_CR3_PCID_NOFLUSH_BIT, %rax)
is a working substitute for the "bts $63, %rax" in these ALTERNATIVEs;
but the one line with $63 in looks clearer, so let's stick with that.

Worried about what happens with an ALTERNATIVE between the jump and
jump label in another ALTERNATIVE?  I was, but have checked the
combinations in SWITCH_KERNEL_CR3_NO_STACK at entry_SYSCALL_64,
and it does a good job.

Subject: x86_64, switch_to(): Load TLS descriptors before switching DS and ES
Patch-mainline: v3.19-rc1
References: bsc#911326, CVE-2014-9419

Otherwise, if buggy user code points DS or ES into the TLS
array, they would be corrupted after a context switch.

This also significantly improves the comments and documents some
gotchas in the code.

Before this patch, the both tests below failed.  With this
patch, the es test passes, although the gsbase test still fails.

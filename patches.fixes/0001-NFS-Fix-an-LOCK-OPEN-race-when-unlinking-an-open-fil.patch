Subject: [PATCH] NFS: Fix an LOCK/OPEN race when unlinking an open file
Git-commit: 11476e9dec39d90fe1e9bf12abc6f3efe35a073d
Patch-mainline: v4.7
References: bsc#956514

At Connectathon 2016, we found that recent upstream Linux clients
would occasionally send a LOCK operation with a zero stateid. This
appeared to happen in close proximity to another thread returning
a delegation before unlinking the same file while it remained open.

Earlier, the client received a write delegation on this file and
returned the open stateid. Now, as it is getting ready to unlink the
file, it returns the write delegation. But there is still an open
file descriptor on that file, so the client must OPEN the file
again before it returns the delegation.

Since commit 24311f884189 ('NFSv4: Recovery of recalled read
delegations is broken'), nfs_open_delegation_recall() clears the
NFS_DELEGATED_STATE flag _before_ it sends the OPEN. This allows a
racing LOCK on the same inode to be put on the wire before the OPEN
operation has returned a valid open stateid.

To eliminate this race, serialize delegation return with the
acquisition of a file lock on the same file. Adopt the same approach
as is used in the unlock path.

This patch also eliminates a similar race seen when sending a LOCK
operation at the same time as returning a delegation on the same file.

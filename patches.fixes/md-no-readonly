Subject: [PATCH] md: don't set md arrays to readonly on shutdown.
Patch-mainline: 3.4
References: bnc#740180, bnc#713148, bnc#734900

It seems that with recent kernel, writeback can still be happening
while shutdown is happening, and consequently data can be written
after the md reboot notifier switches all arrays to read-only.
This causes a BUG.

So don't switch them to read-only - just mark them clean and
set 'safemode' to '2' which mean that immediately after any
write the array will be switch back to 'clean'.

This could result in the shutdown happening when array is marked
dirty, thus forcing a resync on reboot.  However if you reboot
without performing a "sync" first, you get to keep both halves.

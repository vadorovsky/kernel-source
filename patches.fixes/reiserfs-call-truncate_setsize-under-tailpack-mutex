Subject: reiserfs: call truncate_setsize under tailpack mutex
References: bnc#878115
Patch-mainline: submitted to reiserfs-devel, 21 May 2014

Prior to commit 0e4f6a791b1e (Fix reiserfs_file_release()), reiserfs
truncates serialized on i_mutex. They mostly still do, with the exception
of reiserfs_file_release. That blocks out other writers via the tailpack
mutex and the inode openers counter adjusted in reiserfs_file_open.

However, NFS will call reiserfs_setattr without having called ->open, so
we end up with a race when nfs is calling ->setattr while another
process is releasing the file. Ultimately, it triggers the
BUG_ON(inode->i_size != new_file_size) check in maybe_indirect_to_direct.

The solution is to pull the lock into reiserfs_setattr to encompass the
truncate_setsize call as well.

Subject: [PATCH 1/6] arm64: Use full path in KBUILD_IMAGE definition
Git-commit: 06995804b5762f016c7a80503406da853a8f3785
Patch-mainline: v4.12-rc1
References: bsc#1010032

The KBUILD_IMAGE variable is used by the rpm and deb-pkg targets, which
expect it to point to the image file in the build directory. The
builddeb script has a workaround for architectures which only provide
the basename, but let's provide a clean interface for packaging tools.

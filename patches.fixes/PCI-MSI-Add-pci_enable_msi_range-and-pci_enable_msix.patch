Subject: PCI/MSI: Add pci_enable_msi_range() and pci_enable_msix_range()
Patch-mainline: v3.14-rc1
Git-commit: 302a2523c277bea0bbe8340312b09507905849ed
References: bnc#908322 FATE#317535

This adds pci_enable_msi_range(), which supersedes the pci_enable_msi()
and pci_enable_msi_block() MSI interfaces.

It also adds pci_enable_msix_range(), which supersedes the
pci_enable_msix() MSI-X interface.

The old interfaces have three categories of return values:

    negative: failure; caller should not retry
    positive: failure; value indicates number of interrupts that *could*
	have been allocated, and caller may retry with a smaller request
    zero: success; at least as many interrupts allocated as requested

It is error-prone to handle these three cases correctly in drivers.

The new functions return either a negative error code or a number of
successfully allocated MSI/MSI-X interrupts, which is expected to lead to
clearer device driver code.

pci_enable_msi(), pci_enable_msi_block() and pci_enable_msix() still exist
unchanged, but are deprecated and may be removed after callers are updated.

+

+
+4.2.1.1 Maximum possible number of MSI interrupts
+
+The typical usage of MSI interrupts is to allocate as many vectors as

+
+Note the value of 'minvec' parameter is 1.  As 'minvec' is inclusive,
+the value of 0 would be meaningless and could result in error.
+
+Some devices have a minimal limit on number of MSI interrupts.

+static int foo_driver_enable_msi(struct pci_dev *pdev, int nvec)

+4.2.1.2 Exact number of MSI interrupts

+If a driver is unable or unwilling to deal with a variable number of MSI
+interrupts it could request a particular number of interrupts by passing
+that number to pci_enable_msi_range() function as both 'minvec' and 'maxvec'

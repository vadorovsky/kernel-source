Subject: [PATCH] md/raid5: ensure correct assessment of drives during
 degraded reshape.
Patch-mainline: 3.3
References: bcn#741289

[This patch is very different from the mainline one as the
code has changed a lot. - NB ]

While reshaping a degraded array (as when reshaping a RAID0 by first
converting it to a degraded RAID4) we currently get confused about
which devices are in_sync.  In most cases we get it right, but in the
region that is being reshaped we need to treat non-failed devices as
in-sync when we have the data but haven't actually written it out yet.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: vmscan: Do not continue scanning if reclaim was aborted
 for compaction

References: Limit reclaim in the preserve of IO (bnc#754690)
Patch-mainline: No, expected 3.11

Direct reclaim is not aborting to allow compaction to go ahead properly.
do_try_to_free_pages is told to abort reclaim which is happily ignores
and instead increases priority instead until it reaches 0 and starts
shrinking file/anon equally. This patch corrects the situation by
aborting reclaim when requested instead of raising priority.

Subject: [PATCH 4/4] xfs: don't assert fail on non-async buffers on ioacct
 decrement
Git-commit: 4dd3fd7197303739094183b139bae3142a3d55e6
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc3
References: bsc#1024508

The buffer I/O accounting mechanism tracks async buffers under I/O.  As
an optimization, the buffer I/O count is incremented only once on the
first async I/O for a given hold cycle of a buffer and decremented once
the buffer is released to the LRU (or freed).

xfs_buf_ioacct_dec() has an ASSERT() check for an XBF_ASYNC buffer, but
we have one or two corner cases where a buffer can be submitted for I/O
multiple times via different methods in a single hold cycle. If an async
I/O occurs first, the I/O count is incremented. If a sync I/O occurs
before the hold count drops, XBF_ASYNC is cleared by the time the I/O
count is decremented.

Remove the async assert check from xfs_buf_ioacct_dec() as this is a
perfectly valid scenario. For the purposes of I/O accounting, we really
only care about the buffer async state at I/O submission time.

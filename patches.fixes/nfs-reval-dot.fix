Subject: [PATCH] nfs - handle d_revalidate of 'dot' correctly.
Patch-mainline: Upstream doesn't seem to care.
References: bnc#731809

When d_revalidate is called on a dentry because FS_REVAL_DOT is set
it isn't really appropriate to revalidate the name.

If the path was simply ".", then the current-working-directory could
have been renamed on the server and should still be accessible as "."
even if it has a new name.

If the path was "/some/long/path/.", then the final component ("path" in
this case) has already been revalidated and there is no particular
need to do it again.

If we change nd->last_type to refer to "the last component looked at"
rather than just "the last component", then these cases can be
detected by "nd->last_type != LAST_NORM".

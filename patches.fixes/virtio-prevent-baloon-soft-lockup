Subject: virtio_balloon: don't softlockup on huge balloon changes
Git-commit: 1f74ef0f2d7d692fcd615621e0e734c3e7771413
Patch-mainline: 3.15
References: bnc#871899 
    
    When adding or removing 100G from a balloon:
    
        BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [vballoon:367]
    
    We have a wait_event_interruptible(), but the condition is always true
    (more ballooning to do) so we don't ever sleep.  We also have a
    wait_event() for the host to ack, but that is also always true as QEMU
    is synchronous for balloon operations.

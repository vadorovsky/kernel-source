Subject: [PATCH 207/242] bnx2x: save RAM in kdump kernel by disabling TPA
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1

Git-commit: 94d9de3cf7b7902253e65d7aef30f2db051c1ac6
References: bsc#908684 FATE#317539


When running in a kdump kernel, disable TPA. This saves memory, which
tends to be scarce in kdump.

TPA, being a receive acceleration, is unlikely to be useful for kdump,
whose purpose is to send the memory image out.

This saves additional 5 MB in the kdump environment.

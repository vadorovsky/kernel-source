Subject: [PATCH v2 27/31] bnx2: Don't receive packets when the napi budget ==
 0
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc1

Git-commit: 310c4d4e23d191156810f402c747e5e17c4dc0b1
References: bsc#908686 FATE#317538


Processing any incoming packets with a with a napi budget of 0
is incorrect driver behavior.

This matters as netpoll will shortly call drivers with a budget of 0
to avoid receive packet processing happening in hard irq context.

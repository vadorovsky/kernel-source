Subject: NVMe: default to 4k device page size
Git-commit: c5c9f25b98a568451d665afe4aeefe17bf9f2995
Patch-mainline: v4.4-rc3
References: bsc#967042

We received a bug report recently when DDW (64-bit direct DMA on Power)
is not enabled for NVMe devices. In that case, we fall back to 32-bit
DMA via the IOMMU, which is always done via 4K TCEs (Translation Control
Entries).

The NVMe device driver, though, assumes that the DMA alignment for the
PRP entries will match the device's page size, and that the DMA aligment
matches the kernel's page aligment. On Power, the the IOMMU page size,
as mentioned above, can be 4K, while the device can have a page size of
8K, while the kernel has a page size of 64K. This eventually trips the
BUG_ON in nvme_setup_prps(), as we have a 'dma_len' that is a multiple
of 4K but not 8K (e.g., 0xF000).

In this particular case of page sizes, we clearly want to use the
IOMMU's page size in the driver. And generally, the NVMe driver in this
function should be using the IOMMU's page size for the default device
page size, rather than the kernel's page size. There is not currently an
API to obtain the IOMMU's page size across all architectures and in the
interest of a stop-gap fix to this functional issue, default the NVMe
device page size to 4K, with the intent of adding such an API and
implementation across all architectures in the next merge window.

With the functionally equivalent v3 of this patch, our hardware test
exerciser survives when using 32-bit DMA; without the patch, the kernel
will BUG within a few minutes.

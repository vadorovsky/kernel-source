Subject: nvme_fc: correct hang in nvme_ns_remove()
Date: Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:21:38 -0800
Patch-mainline: Submitted, http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2018-January/014854.html
References: bsc#1075811

When connectivity is lost to a device, the association is terminated
and the blk-mq queues are quiesced/stopped. When connectivity is
re-established, they are resumed.

If connectivity is lost for a sufficient amount of time that the
controller is then deleted, the delete path starts tearing down queues,
and eventually calling nvme_ns_remove(). It appears that pending
commands may cause blk_cleanup_queue() to never complete and the
teardown stalls.

Correct by starting the ns queues after transitioning to a DELETING
state, allowing pending commands to be flushed with io failures. Thus
the delete path is clear when reached.

Subject: of: of_mdio: Add a whitelist of PHY compatibilities.
Patch-mainline: v4.5-rc3
Git-commit: ae461131960b27d4be158d62a89d40977388d7a1
References: bsc#1026030 FATE#321670

Some phy nodes list a compatible value indicating the PHY make/model.
This is never used to match the device to the driver. However it does
confuse the code to separate a PHY from a generic MDIO device like a
switch. Generic MDIO devices must have a compatible value, PHYs can
list clause 22 or 45, but nothing else.

Issue a warning if we find a compatible value known on the whitelist,
and say it is a PHY.

Fixes: a9049e0c513c ("mdio: Add support for mdio drivers.")

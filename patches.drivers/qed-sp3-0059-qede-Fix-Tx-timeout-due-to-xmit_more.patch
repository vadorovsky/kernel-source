Subject: qede: Fix Tx timeout due to xmit_more
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc5
Git-commit: 039a392733600d35c80d406a98151b2a9a0a74b4
References: bsc#1019695 FATE#321703 bsc#1019699 FATE#321702 bsc#1022604 FATE#321747

Driver uses netif_tx_queue_stopped() to make sure the xmit_more
indication will be honored, but that only checks for DRV_XOFF.

At the same time, it's possible that during transmission the DQL will
close the transmission queue with STACK_XOFF indication.
In re-configuration flows, when the threshold is relatively low, it's
possible that the device has no pending tranmissions, and during
tranmission the driver would miss doorbelling the HW.
Since there are no pending transmission, there will never be a Tx
completion [and thus the DQL would not remove the STACK_XOFF indication],
eventually causing the Tx queue to timeout.

While we're at it - also doorbell in case driver has to close the
transmission queue on its own [although this one is less important -
if the ring is full, we're bound to receive completion eventually,
which means the doorbell would only be postponed and not indefinetly
blocked].

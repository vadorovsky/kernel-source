Subject: [PATCH] net/tg3: Release IRQs on permanent error
Patch-mainline: v4.1-rc2
Git-commit: dfc8f370316b31b9ca9ce96e50f1c438d9410b4f
References: bsc#90458 FATE#317507 bsc#925107

When having permanent EEH error, the PCI device will be removed
from the system. For this case, we shouldn't set pcierr_recovery
to true wrongly, which blocks the driver to release the allocated
interrupts and their handlers. Eventually, we can't disable MSI
or MSIx successfully because of the MSI or MSIx interrupts still
have associated interrupt actions, which is turned into following
stack dump.

Oops: Exception in kernel mode, sig: 5 [#1]

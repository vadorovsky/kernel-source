Subject: [PATCH 182/242] bnx2x: fix AFEX memory overflow
Patch-mainline: v3.13-rc8

Git-commit: 9dfef3adaebb42163d691be73e05b12da440cbe5
References: bsc#908684 FATE#317539


There are 2 different (related) flows in the slowpath configuration
that utilize the same pointer and cast it to different structs;
This is obviously incorrect as the intended allocated memory is that
of the smaller struct, possibly causing the flow utilizing the larger
struct to corrupt other slowpath configuration.

Since both flows are exclusive, set the allocated memory to be a union
of both structs.

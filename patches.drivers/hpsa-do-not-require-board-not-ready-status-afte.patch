Subject: [SCSI] hpsa: do not require board "not ready" status after hard reset
References: bnc#913241,FATE#317338
Patch-Mainline: v3.15
Git-commit: 0ddf1d77505fd97daa7fc70bb0498c54a5c33725

Immediately following a hard board reset, There are some
mandatory delays during which we must not access the board
and during which we might miss the "not ready" status,
therefore it is a mistake to look for and expect to see
the "not ready" status.

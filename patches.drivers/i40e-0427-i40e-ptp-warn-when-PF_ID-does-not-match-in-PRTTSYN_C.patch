Subject: [PATCH v3 427/474] i40e: (ptp) warn when PF_ID does not match in
 PRTTSYN_CTL0
Patch-mainline: v3.17-rc1
Git-commit: 302b46449e2918a30b3f98a54653972d2ad0f072
References: bsc#909484 FATE#317397

Display a verbose warning message when the incorrect PF attempts to
control timestamping for a port to which it was not assigned. This
shouldn't display except in the case of multiple PFs per port. The
primary intent of this message is to help debugging the reason why the
SIOCSHWTSTAMP ioctl has failed, and to help narrow the cause of the
issue.

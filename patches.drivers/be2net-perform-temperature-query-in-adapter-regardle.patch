Subject: [PATCH] be2net: perform temperature query in adapter regardless of
 its interface state
Patch-mainline: v4.8-rc1
Git-commit: d3480615cf00c6f615cdb61a9d03386574b93342
References: bsc#990973

The be2net driver performs fw temperature queries on be_worker() routine,
which is executed each second for each be_adapter. There is a frequency
threshold to avoid fw query to happens at each call to be_worker();
instead, currently a fw query occurs once in 64 runs of the procedure.

Nevertheless, this fw temperature query is invoked only for adapters which
interface is up, so we can see I/O errors on read of hwmon counters from
userspace (from tools like lm-sensors) in case we have adapters' functions
which interface is down.

This patch moves the fw query code to be invoked even if interface is down.
No functional changes were introduced.

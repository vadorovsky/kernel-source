Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: fallback mechanism if MCLK is not enabled
Patch-mainline: v4.10-rc4
Git-commit: 4a8b3a682be9addff7dbd16371fa8c34103b5c31
References: bsc#1010690

Commit df1a2776a795 ("ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: add MCLK support")
was merged but the corresponding clock framework patches have not,
after being bumped from audio to clock to x86 domains. The missing
clock-related patches result in a regression starting with 4.9 with
the audio card not being created.

Rather than reverting this commit and all following updates already
queued up for 4.10, handle run-time dependency on MCLK and fall back
to the previous bit-clock mode. This provides the same functionality
as in 4.8 for Baytrail devices. On Baytrail-CR most devices remain
silent with this fallback but additional patches are needed anyway.
As suggested by Mark Brown, the fallback is only allowed with -ENOENT,
all other run-time errors, including -EPROBE_DEFER, will stop the probe
with no sound card registered.

This patch should be applied to -stable as well as ASoC 4.10 fixes

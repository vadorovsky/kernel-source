Subject: NVMe: Protect against badly formatted CQEs
References: bnc#913030,FATE#317455
Patch-Mainline: v3.17
Git-commit: 94bbac4052eb93219ca0aa370ca741486b25fb98

If a misbehaving device posts a CQE with a command id < depth but for
one that was never allocated, the command info will have a callback
function set to NULL and we don't want to try invoking that.

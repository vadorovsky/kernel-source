Subject: drm/kms: Make i2c buses faster
Git-commit: 1849ecb22fb3b5d57b65e7369a3957adf9f26f39
Patch-mainline: v3.4-rc1

A udelay value of 20 leads to an I2C bus running at only 25 kbps. I2C
devices can typically operate faster than this, 50 kbps should be fine
for all devices (and compliant devices can always stretch the clock if
needed.)

FWIW, the vast majority of framebuffer drivers set udelay to 10
already. So set it to 10 in DRM drivers too, this will make EDID block
reads faster. We might even lower the udelay value later if no problem
is reported.

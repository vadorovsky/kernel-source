Subject: [PATCH] dm io: fix duplicate bio completion due to missing ref count
Patch-mainline: 4.4.121
References: bnc#1012382 bsc#1043520
Git-commit: feb7695fe9fb83084aa29de0094774f4c9d4c9fc

commit feb7695fe9fb83084aa29de0094774f4c9d4c9fc upstream.

If only a subset of the devices associated with multiple regions support
a given special operation (eg. DISCARD) then the dec_count() that is
used to set error for the region must increment the io->count.

Otherwise, when the dec_count() is called it can cause the dm-io
caller's bio to be completed multiple times.  As was reported against
the dm-mirror target that had mirror legs with a mix of discard
capabilities.

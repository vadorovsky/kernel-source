Subject: [PATCH 03/42] KVM: provide synchronous registers in kvm_run
Git-commit: 2c60b9dd4ccde21bb583029d5d0c8b65bf6a088c
References: FATE#314101,FATE#310914
Patch-mainline: Merged into kvm

On some cpus the overhead for virtualization instructions is in the same
range as a system call. Having to call multiple ioctls to get set registers
will make certain userspace handled exits more expensive than necessary.
Lets provide a section in kvm_run that works as a shared save area
for guest registers.
We also provide two 64bit flags fields (architecture specific), that will
specify
1. which parts of these fields are valid.
2. which registers were modified by userspace

Each bit for these flag fields will define a group of registers (like
general purpose) or a single register.

+If KVM_CAP_SYNC_REGS is defined, these fields allow userspace to access
+certain guest registers without having to call SET/GET_*REGS. Thus we can
+avoid some system call overhead if userspace has to handle the exit.
+Userspace can query the validity of the structure by checking
+kvm_valid_regs for specific bits. These bits are architecture specific
+and usually define the validity of a groups of registers. (e.g. one bit
+ for general purpose registers)

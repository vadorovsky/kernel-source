Description:  af_iucv: avoid path quiesce of severed path in shutdown()
Symptom:      sendmsg() returns with -EPIPE during a stress test
Problem:      This is caused by quiescing a path even though it has
              been already severed by peer. For IUCV transport shutdown()
              consists of 2 steps:
              (1) sending the shutdown message to peer
              (2) quiescing the iucv path
              If the iucv path between these 2 steps is severed due to peer
              closing the path, the quiesce step is no longer needed.
Solution:     In iucv_sock_shutdown() make sure path_quiesce() is called only
              if the iucv path is still available.
Reproduction: Run af_iucv stress test for af_iucv sockets with IUCV transport.

Upstream-Description:

              af_iucv: avoid path quiesce of severed path in shutdown()

              An af_iucv stress test showed -EPIPE results for sendmsg()
              calls. They are caused by quiescing a path even though it has
              been already severed by peer. For IUCV transport shutdown()
              consists of 2 steps:
              (1) sending the shutdown message to peer
              (2) quiescing the iucv path
              If the iucv path between these 2 steps is severed due to peer
              closing the path, the quiesce step is no longer needed.

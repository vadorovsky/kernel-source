Subject: ia64: Merge overlapping reserved regions
Patch-mainline: not yet
References: bnc#73149
 
Panic kernel fails early during boot on ia64, because the initial register
backing store gets overwritten with zeroes.

Further investigation revealed that rsvd_region[] contains overlapping 
entries: find_memmap_space() returns a pointer which lies between KERNEL_START 
and _end. This is correct with the EFI memmap as patched by the kexec 
purgatory code. That code removes vmlinux LOAD segments from the usable map, 
but there is a pretty large hole between the gate section and the per-cpu 
section.

With the following patch, the panic kernel can boot and save the crash dump.

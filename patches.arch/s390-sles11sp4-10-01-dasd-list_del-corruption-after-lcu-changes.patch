Description:  dasd: Fix list_del corruption after lcu changes.
Symptom:      A list_del_corruption in the DASD device driver occurs
              after changes to the LCU on the storage server.
Problem:      A summary unit check occurs when the lcu updates the PAV
              configuration e.g. base PAV assignment or PAV mode at
              all. This requires the reset of the drivers internal
              pavgroups. Therefore the alias devices are flushed and
              moved via a temporary list to the active_devices list
              where they are not associated with a pavgroup. In
              conjunction with updates to the base device the pavgroup
              may be removed since both base_list and alias_list are
              empty. Unfortunately during alias flush and move to the
              active_device list from alias_list the pavgroup pointer
              is not deleted in the device private structure. This
              leads to a list del_corruption if another lcu_update
              tries to move the device in the non existent pavgroup.
Solution:     Fix by removing the pavgroup pointer after the alias
              device was moved to the active_devices list.
Reproduction: Changes to the LCU on the storage server occur while base
              and alias devices are active in linux.

              s390/dasd: fix list_del corruption after lcu changes

              A summary unit check occurs when the lcu updates the PAV configuration
              e.g. base PAV assignment or PAV mode at all. This requires the reset
              of the drivers internal pavgroups. Therefore the alias devices are
              flushed and moved via a temporary list to the active_devices list
              where they are not associated with a pavgroup. In conjunction with
              updates to the base device the pavgroup may be removed since both
              base_list and alias_list are empty. Unfortunately during alias flush
              and move to the active_device list from alias_list the pavgroup
              pointer is not deleted in the device private structure. This leads to
              a list del_corruption if another lcu_update tries to move the device
              in the non existent pavgroup.

              Fix by removing the pavgroup pointer after the alias device was moved
              to the active_devices list.

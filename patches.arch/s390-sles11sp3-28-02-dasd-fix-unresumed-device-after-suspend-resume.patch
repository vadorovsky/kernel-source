Description:  dasd: Fix unresumed device after suspend/resume.
Symptom:      DASD devices are not responding after a suspend
              resume cycle.
Problem:      The DASD device driver only has a limited amount of
              memory to build I/O requests.
              This memory was used by blocklayer requests leading to
              an inability to build needed internal requests to resume
              the device.
Solution:     Fix by preventing the DASD driver to fetch requests for
              a stopped device.
Reproduction: Do suspend/resume cycles with DASD devices attached and
              I/O load.

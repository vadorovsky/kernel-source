Subject: [PATCH 022/221] soc/qman: Add self-test for QMan driver
Git-commit: de7756233994b48cfc4d948904380cd0453a0063
Patch-mainline: v4.9-rc1
References: FATE#320030

Add self tests for the DPAA 1.x Queue Manager driver. The tests
ensure that the driver can properly enqueue and dequeue to/from
frame queues using the QMan portal infrastructure.

+/*
+ * Algorithm:
+ *
+ * Each cpu will have HP_PER_CPU "handlers" set up, each of which incorporates
+ * an rx/tx pair of FQ objects (both of which are stashed on dequeue). The
+ * organisation of FQIDs is such that the HP_PER_CPU*NUM_CPUS handlers will
+ * shuttle a "hot potato" frame around them such that every forwarding action
+ * moves it from one cpu to another. (The use of more than one handler per cpu
+ * is to allow enough handlers/FQs to truly test the significance of caching -
+ * ie. when cache-expiries are occurring.)
+ *
+ * The "hot potato" frame content will be HP_NUM_WORDS*4 bytes in size, and the
+ * first and last words of the frame data will undergo a transformation step on
+ * each forwarding action. To achieve this, each handler will be assigned a
+ * 32-bit "mixer", that is produced using a 32-bit LFSR. When a frame is
+ * received by a handler, the mixer of the expected sender is XOR'd into all
+ * words of the entire frame, which is then validated against the original
+ * values. Then, before forwarding, the entire frame is XOR'd with the mixer of
+ * the current handler. Apart from validating that the frame is taking the
+ * expected path, this also provides some quasi-realistic overheads to each
+ * forwarding action - dereferencing *all* the frame data, computation, and
+ * conditional branching. There is a "special" handler designated to act as the
+ * instigator of the test by creating an enqueuing the "hot potato" frame, and
+ * to determine when the test has completed by counting HP_LOOPS iterations.
+ *
+ * Init phases:
+ *
+ * 1. prepare each cpu's 'hp_cpu' struct using on_each_cpu(,,1) and link them
+ *    into 'hp_cpu_list'. Specifically, set processor_id, allocate HP_PER_CPU
+ *    handlers and link-list them (but do no other handler setup).
+ *
+ * 2. scan over 'hp_cpu_list' HP_PER_CPU times, the first time sets each
+ *    hp_cpu's 'iterator' to point to its first handler. With each loop,
+ *    allocate rx/tx FQIDs and mixer values to the hp_cpu's iterator handler
+ *    and advance the iterator for the next loop. This includes a final fixup,
+ *    which connects the last handler to the first (and which is why phase 2
+ *    and 3 are separate).
+ *
+ * 3. scan over 'hp_cpu_list' HP_PER_CPU times, the first time sets each
+ *    hp_cpu's 'iterator' to point to its first handler. With each loop,
+ *    initialise FQ objects and advance the iterator for the next loop.
+ *    Moreover, do this initialisation on the cpu it applies to so that Rx FQ
+ *    initialisation targets the correct cpu.

Subject: [PATCH 218/221] memremap: add MEMREMAP_WC flag
Git-commit: c907e0eb43a522de60fb651c011c553f87273222
Patch-mainline: v4.6-rc1
References: FATE#320030

Add a flag to memremap() for writecombine mappings.  Mappings satisfied
by this flag will not be cached, however writes may be delayed or
combined into more efficient bursts.  This is most suitable for buffers
written sequentially by the CPU for use by other DMA devices.

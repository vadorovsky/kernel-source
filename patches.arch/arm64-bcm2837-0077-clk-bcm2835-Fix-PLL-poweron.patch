Subject: [PATCH 077/101] clk: bcm2835: Fix PLL poweron
Git-commit: 7a8bc0c48caad0d0ff4728b66dad7003e7827302
Patch-mainline: Queued in subsystem maintainer repository
Git-repo: https://github.com/anholt/linux.git
References: FATE#319481

In poweroff, we set the reset bit and the power down bit, but only
managed to unset the reset bit for poweron.  This meant that if HDMI
did -EPROBE_DEFER after it had grabbed its clocks, we'd power down the
PLLH (that had been on at boot time) and never recover.
